## Mouse Shadow

### Description

This will draw a shadow of the mouse as you move it across the form (without any flickering). You can draw the shadow on anything that has a handle. This was kinda tricky to do (removeing the flicker was anyway), but it's actually only about a day's work. Looks cool though. Any suggestions for improving it are very welcome. And thanks in advance to anyone who votes.
